Wordfence starts by checking if your site is already infected. We do a deep server-side scan of your source code comparing it to the Official WordPress repository for core, themes and plugins. Then Wordfence secures your site and makes it up to 50 times faster. 

Wordfence Security is 100% free and open source. We also offer a Premium API key that gives you Premium Support, Country Blocking, Scheduled Scans, Password Auditing and we even check if your website IP address is being used to Spamvertize.

== Installation ==

To install the Wordfence WordPress security plugin and start protecting your WordPress website:

1. Install Wordfence Security automatically or by uploading the ZIP file. 
1. Activate the security plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Wordfence WordPress Security is now activated. Go to the scan menu and start your first security scan. Scheduled security scanning will also be enabled.
1. Once your first scan has completed a list of security threats will appear. Go through them one by one to secure your site.
1. Visit the Wordfence Security options page to enter your email address so that you can receive email security alerts.
1. Optionally change your security level or adjust the advanced options to set individual security scanning and protection options for your site.
1. Click the "Live Traffic" menu option to watch your site activity in real-time. Situational awareness is an important part of website security.

To install the Wordfence WordPress security plugin on WordPress Multi-Site installations:

1. Install Wordfence Security via the plugin directory or by uploading the ZIP file.
1. Network Activate Wordfence Security. This step is important because until you network activate it, your sites will see the plugin option on their plugins menu. Once activated that option dissapears. 
1. Now that Wordfence is network activated it will appear on your Network Admin menu. Wordfence Security will not appear on any individual site's menu. 
1. Go to the "Scan" menu and start your first security scan. 
1. Wordfence Security will do a security scan of all files in your WordPress installation including those in the blogs.dir directory of your individual sites. 
1. Live Traffic will appear for ALL sites in your network. If you have a heavily trafficked system you may want to disable live traffic which will stop logging to the DB. 
1. Firewall rules and login rules apply to the WHOLE system. So if you fail a login on site1.example.com and site2.example.com it counts as 2 failures. Crawler traffic is counted between blogs, so if you hit three sites in the network, all the hits are totalled and that counts as the rate you're accessing the system.

= Does Wordfence Security support Multi-Site installations? =

Yes. WordPress MU or Multi-Site as it's called now is fully supported. Using Wordfence Security you can security scan every blog in your network with one click. If one of your customers posts a page or post with a known malware URL that threatens your whole domain with being blacklisted by Google, we will tell you within a maximum of one hour which is how often scans occur. 

= Will Wordfence Security slow my site down? =

No. Actually it will make your site up to 50X faster when Falcon Engine is enabled, up to 30 times faster with our PHP caching engine and even
without caching Wordfence is extremely fast and uses techniques like caching it's own configuration data to avoid database lookups. Older
versions of Wordfence did incur a slight performance penalty, but we have not only fixed this issue but knocked it out of the park. Wordfence
now makes your site faster than any other caching plugin available!! 

= How often is Wordfence Security updated? =

The Wordfence Security plugin is frequently updated and we update the code on our security scanning servers
more frequently. Our cloud servers are continually updated with the latest known security threats and vulnerabilities so
that we can blog any security threat as soon as it emerges in the wild.

= What if I need support? =

All our paid customers receive priority support. Excellent customer service is a key part
of being a Wordfence Security member. As free or Premium member can visit [support.wordfence.com](http://support.wordfence.com/?utm_source=repo&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=pluginDesc) and where you will find out knowledgebase. If you're a Premium member you can also open a support ticket.

= Can I disable certain security features of Wordfence Security? =

Yes! Simply visit the Options page, click on advanced options and enable or disable the security features you want.

= What if my site security has already been compromised by a hacker? =

Wordfence Security is the only WordPress security plugin that is able to repair core files, themes and plugins on sites where security is already compromised.
However, please note that site security can not be assured unless you do a full reinstall if your site has been hacked. We recommend you only
use Wordfence Security to get your site into a running state in order to recover the data you need to do a full reinstall. A full reinstall is the only
way to ensure site security once you have been hacked. 

= How will I be alerted that my site has a security problem? =

Wordfence Security sends security alerts via email. Once you install Wordfence Security, you will configure a list of email addresses where security alerts will be sent.
When you receive a security alert, make sure you deal with it promptly to ensure your site stays secure.

= My WordPress site is behind a firewall. Doesn't that make it secure? =

If your site is accessible from the web, it means that people you don't know can execute PHP code on your site.
They have to be able to execute PHP code, like the core WordPress code, in order for your site to work. 
Most WordPress security threats allow a hacker to execute PHP code on your website. The challenge hackers
face is how to get their malicious PHP code onto your site to compromise your security. There
are many upload mechanisms that WordPress itself, themes and plugins offer and the vast majority of these
are secure. However, every now and then a hacker discovers an upload mechanism that is not secure or 
a way of fooling your site into allowing an upload. That is usually when security is compromised. Even
though your site is behind a commercial firewall, it still accepts web requests that include uploads and executes PHP code
and as long as it does that, it may become face a security vulnerability at some point.

= Will Wordfence Security protect me against the Timthumb security problem? =

The timthumb security exploit occurred in 2011 and all good plugins and themes now use an updated 
version of timthumb (which the creator of Wordfence Security wrote and donated to the timthumb author) which closes the security hole that
caused the problem. However we do scan for old version of timthumb for good measure to make sure they don't 
cause a security hole on your site. 

= Does Wordfence Security support IPv6? =

Most definitely! As of Wordfence version 6.0.1 we fully support IPv6 with all security functions including country blocking, range blocking,
city lookup, whois lookup and all other security functions. If you are not running IPv6 Wordfence will work great on your site too. We are
fully compatible with both IPv4 and IPv6 whether you run both or only one addressing scheme. 

== Screenshots ==

1. The home screen of Wordfence Security where you can see a summary, manage security issues and do a manual security scan. 
2. The Live Traffic view of Wordfence Security where you can see real-time activity on your site.
3. The "Blocked IPs" page where you can manage blocked IP's, locked out IP's and see recently throttled IPs that violated security rules.
4. The basic view of Wordfence Security options. There is very little to configure other than your alert email address and security level.
5. If you're technically minded, this is the under-the-hood view of Wordfence Security options where you can fine-tune your security settings.

== Changelog ==
